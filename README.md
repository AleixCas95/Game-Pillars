## Game Pillars, the concept.


The foundations of a games are known as Game Pillars. Those Game Pillars are the basis of a game.
Some times people thinks taht Game Pillars and concepts like Unique Selling Points are the same, but it doesn't.

Game basis(Game Design Pillars) are the first concepts every videogame need. In general, there are and average of 3 - 8 primary and fundamental concepts that every game wants and need to be based on. Those also act as filters to discard new ideas during the development.

Every company, developers, every game, has a different set of Game Pilars depending of what concepts they want to base their game.
Every project starts with a set of concepts, Game Pillars, where every part of the group that is developing the game will agree and leave there to develop the game together as a team with the same objective.
