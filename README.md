## Game Pillars, the concept.


The foundations of a games are known as game pillars. Those game pillars are the basis of a game.
Some times people thinks taht game pillars and concepts like Unique Selling Points are the same, but it doesn't.

Game basis(Game Design Pillars) are the first concepts every videogame need. In general, there are and average of 3 - 8 primary and fundamental concepts that every game wants and need to be based on. Those also act as filters to discard new ideas during the development.

Every company, developers, every game, has a different set of Game Pilars depending of what concepts they want to base their game.
Every project starts with a set of concepts, game pillars, where every part of the group that is developing the game will agree and leave there to develop the game together as a team with the same objective.


# Which Game Pillars were defined in professional games ?

As arleady mentioned before, every videogame has a diferent set of game pillars. 
Most of the cases each progessional game, each videogame development process has a GDD, that is created and edited by the development team(in our case will be the designer of the game) to  use it as a guide of the general vision during the game development process.

#### Five general concepts of game pillars (Team based):

Every professional game has his own game pillars, therefore we can not make a set of game pillars as standards but here you can find some example of a game pillars of well-known games:

### Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

__Exploration:__ Player are encouraged to explore, by being able to go to any area they wish whenever they wish.

__Traversal movement:__  Breath of the Wild offers so many modes of transport, each being as fun as one another. From, climbing, swimming, running, paragliding to the amazing shield surfing.

__Scavenging:__ Players are constantly needing to go through the world and search for items. From weapons which break after a few battles, to the food players must use to regain health or help them traverse through all kind of environmental hazards.

__Options:__ This game is praised all around for a number of options that are given to the player. From multiple ways to solve puzzles to the combat scenarios or how the player makes their way around the world.

__Combat:__ Now you have loads of combat in this game and a number of enemy. Lesser pillar in a general opion but still fighting .

### The Last of Us:

__Crafting:__ Ammo is scarce, so to distract or cause a higher amount of damage to one’s foes it is better to use items populating the world. This works in unison with the environmental story telling of how this is not many resources left in this world.

__Story:__ Last of Us is a linear game which is heavily narrative lead, they want everything to tie in with the story as mentioned with crafting. The game focuses on the story of the two main characters rather than the player’s own story.

__AI partners:__ The game is all about building a relationship between the player’s character with the AI partner Ellie and other partners you meet throughout your journey.

__Stealth:__ Combat is used in this game, but if you were to run and gun, then the game would make your life extremely difficult. So player are encouraged to play more stealthily

### The Binding of Isaac Rebirth

__Story:__ The Binding of Isaac Rebirth has a simple history like the original game, easy to remember and clear for all the players who play it and the one's who don't. Character crying who has to escape from his mother.

__Shooter:__ RPG shooter with heavy roguelike elements.(Dunegon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turned-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player character).

__Random factor:__ Although the hisotry is always the same, the way is always different. A large amount of items obtained randomly across the game make the player feel a diferent gameplay every time he plays.

__Pause:__ Seems like something common but this remake has the option of pause. Being able to pause but not save makes the game less heavy if the player wants to make a runa pause is not obligated to play without being able to stop.




## Why we have to establish a good set of Game Pillars?
